# Hamming Codes
The Hamming codes are an important family of linear single-error-correcting codes which are easy to encode and decode which can be defined over any finite field $GF(q)$.

### Definition of a binary Hamming codes
Let r be a positive integer and let H be an $r x 2^r - 1$ matrix whose columns are the distinct nonzero vectors of V(r, 2). Then the code having H as its parity-check matrix is called a binary Hamming code and is denoted by Ham(r, 2).
